# FairfaxDev

Over my years of developing websites for others I've always wanted to build one for myself to showcase my works and share my knowledge. As most developers know, when building something for yourself, it is never perfect and will forever be tweaked.

## Key things I wanted for my site:

- Low Cost: As the site will be permanently running, I wanted it to cost as minimal as possible.
- Low Maintenance: I wanted to be able to update the site content without having to modify the code.
- Showcase my Abilities:
    - Visually as a Web Designer
    - Technically as a Web Developer
    - Knowledgeably as a Web Marketer
